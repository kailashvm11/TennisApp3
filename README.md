# Tennis App
Tennis App is an console based interactive Java application which calculates
the score of a Tennis game and finds the winner between two players A and B.

The app calculates the Game score with below rules


|Number of points won |	Corresponding call  |
|   :---------:       |      :---------:    |	
|       0	          |       "love"        |	
|       1	          |        "15"         |
|       2	          |        "30"         |
|       3	          |        "40"         |
|       4	          |        "Game"       |

A game is won when a player scores four (or more) points: 15, 30, 40 and the game-winning point.

When both players reach 40 points the score is called **Deuce**.
From this point forward, a player has to win at least two consecutive points to win the Game
When the score is on Deuce the player who wins the next point is said to hold on **Advantage**.
If he wins the next point he wins the game or if he loses the next point the score becomes
Deuce again.
